# Gait or Speech Extraction from Video or Audio

This project aims to predict Parkinson's disease using Python. It involves two main aspects:

## Gait Predictor

The `Gait_Predictor` module (`gait_predictor.py`) is designed to extract features from a patient's walking patterns. These extracted features are then utilized to predict whether the patient is likely to have Parkinson's disease or not.

### Usage:

To use the `Gait_Predictor` module:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Execute the `gait_predictor.py` file with appropriate inputs to extract features.

## Speech Assessment

The `Speech_Assessment` module (`SpeechAssessment.py`) is responsible for extracting voice-related features from patients. These features are then used in predicting whether the patient might have Parkinson's disease.

### Usage:

To utilize the `Speech Assessment` module:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by executing:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the `SpeechAssessment.py` file with the necessary inputs to extract voice features.

## Requirements

The project root directory contains a `requirements.txt` file listing the necessary Python libraries and versions required to run the project.

### Installation

To install the project dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies as described above.
3. Execute the respective Python files (`gait_predictor.py` and `SpeechAssessment.py`) with the relevant inputs to predict Parkinson's disease based on gait and speech features, respectively.

## Note

Ensure that proper input data is provided for accurate predictions. For any issues or inquiries, please contact the project maintainers.
